# Bytecode Instruction Issues

This file documents behavioral anomalies, potential bugs, and design concerns
found during the comprehensive bytecode unit-test effort.  Each entry includes
the affected instruction(s), a description of the original behavior, the risk
level, and the resolution.

Entries are added as tests discover them — the tests themselves contain
`// See bytecode/ISSUES.md` comments pointing here.

## BRANCH-1 — Stack mutated before address validation in conditional branches

**Affected instructions:** `branchFalseByteCode`, `branchTrueByteCode`  
**File:** `bytecode/branch.go`  
**Risk:** Medium — stack corruption visible after caught runtime errors  
**Discovered by:** `Test_branchFalseByteCode_StackPreservedOnAddressError`,
`Test_branchTrueByteCode_StackPreservedOnAddressError`  
**Status: RESOLVED**

### BRANCH-1: Original behavior

Both conditional branch instructions popped the top-of-stack (TOS) value
**before** validating the branch destination address.  The sequence was:

```text
1. v, err := c.Pop()         ← TOS consumed here
2. [strict-mode type check]
3. if address out-of-range → return ErrInvalidBytecodeAddress
```

When step 3 returned an error the Pop in step 1 had already been committed.
If the error was caught by a surrounding `try/catch` block in Ego code, the
stack was one item shorter than the caller expected, causing subsequent
instructions to read wrong values or underflow.

### BRANCH-1: Fix

The `validateBranchAddress` helper was extracted and called **before** any
`c.Pop()` call.  The new execution order is:

1. Validate address (no stack side effects).
2. `c.Pop()` — only reached when the address is known valid.
3. Strict-mode type constraint.
4. Coerce to bool and conditionally update the program counter.

Tests `Test_branchFalseByteCode_StackPreservedOnAddressError` and
`Test_branchTrueByteCode_StackPreservedOnAddressError` confirm that the TOS
value remains on the stack after an address-validation error.

## BRANCH-2 — nil operand silently accepted as address 0

**Affected instructions:** `branchByteCode`, `branchFalseByteCode`,
`branchTrueByteCode`  
**File:** `bytecode/branch.go`  
**Risk:** Low — only triggers if the compiler emits a nil operand, which is
not expected in well-formed bytecode  
**Discovered by:** `Test_branchByteCode_NilOperand`,
`Test_branchFalseByteCode_NilOperand_Rejected`,
`Test_branchTrueByteCode_NilOperand_Rejected`  
**Status: RESOLVED**

### BRANCH-2: Original behavior

`data.Int(nil)` returns `(0, nil)`.  Since address 0 is always a valid branch
target, passing `nil` as the operand to any branch instruction silently set the
program counter to 0 rather than returning an error.  This masked compiler bugs
where a branch operand was accidentally left nil.

### BRANCH-2: Fix

An explicit nil check was added at the top of `validateBranchAddress` (called
by all three branch instructions) before `data.Int` is invoked:

```go
if i == nil {
    return 0, c.runtimeError(errors.ErrInvalidBytecodeAddress).Context("nil")
}
```

`Test_branchByteCode_NilOperand` was updated to expect `ErrInvalidBytecodeAddress`
instead of `nil`.  Two new tests were added for the conditional variants.

## BRANCH-3 — Misleading error context for non-integer operands

**Affected instructions:** `branchByteCode`, `branchFalseByteCode`,
`branchTrueByteCode`  
**File:** `bytecode/branch.go`  
**Risk:** Low — only affects diagnostic error messages, not correctness  
**Discovered by:** `Test_branchByteCode_NonIntOperand`  
**Status: RESOLVED**

### BRANCH-3: Original behavior

When `data.Int(i)` failed because the operand was not an integer, the code
used the `address` variable (zero-valued on failure) as the error context:

```go
if address, err := data.Int(i); err != nil || ... {
    return c.runtimeError(errors.ErrInvalidBytecodeAddress).Context(address)
}
```

The error message read `"invalid bytecode address: 0"` even when the actual
operand was, for example, the string `"not-a-number"`.

### BRANCH-3: Fix

The `validateBranchAddress` helper separates the two failure modes.  When
`data.Int` itself fails the original operand `i` is used as context; when the
conversion succeeds but the address is out of range the numeric address is
used:

```go
address, err := data.Int(i)
if err != nil {
    // Show the actual bad operand, not the zero-value placeholder.
    return 0, c.runtimeError(errors.ErrInvalidBytecodeAddress).Context(i)
}
if address < 0 || address > c.bc.nextAddress {
    // Address is a valid int but out of the legal range.
    return 0, c.runtimeError(errors.ErrInvalidBytecodeAddress).Context(address)
}
```

## CALL-1 — Argument count mismatch silently ignored for non-variadic functions with default ArgCount

**Affected function:** `validateArgCount`  
**File:** `bytecode/call.go`  
**Risk:** Medium — runtime functions can be called with the wrong number of
arguments and no error is raised  
**Discovered by:** `Test_validateArgCount_DefaultArgCountZeroZero_Mismatch`  
**Status: RESOLVED**

### CALL-1: Original behavior

`validateArgCount` wrapped its mismatch logic in `if argumentCount != argc { ... }`.
Inside that block the first sub-block fired whenever `dp.Declaration` was
non-nil and non-variadic:

```go
if dp.Declaration != nil && !dp.Declaration.Variadic && len(dp.Declaration.ArgCount) == 2 {
    minArgc := dp.Declaration.ArgCount[0]
    maxArgc := dp.Declaration.ArgCount[1]

    if minArgc >= 0 && maxArgc > 0 && (argc < minArgc || argc > maxArgc) {
        return c.runtimeError(errors.ErrArgumentCount).Context(argc)
    }

    return nil  // ← unconditional return
}
```

Because `ArgCount` is `[2]int`, `len(dp.Declaration.ArgCount) == 2` was
**always true**.  The block fired for every non-nil non-variadic declaration
and always returned — via the error path or the bare `return nil`.

When `ArgCount` held its zero value `[2]int{0, 0}`, `maxArgc == 0` so
`maxArgc > 0` was false, the error was not triggered, and `return nil` was
reached unconditionally, silently accepting the argument count mismatch.

The two code paths below this block — the extensions check and the variadic
check — were dead code for all non-nil non-variadic declarations.

### CALL-1: Fix

`validateArgCount` was restructured to separate the three cases cleanly:

1. Non-variadic with an explicit ArgCount range (`max > 0`): enforce
   `[min, max]` and return.
2. Non-variadic with default ArgCount (`[0, 0]`) and extensions disabled:
   the exact count is required — return `ErrArgumentCount`.
3. Non-variadic with default ArgCount and extensions enabled: allow the
   function to validate its own arg count — return nil.
4. Variadic or nil Declaration: require at least `argumentCount-1` args.

The outer `if argumentCount != argc` block was also replaced with an early
return (`if argumentCount == argc { return nil }`) which removes one level of
nesting and makes the structure clearer.

`Test_validateArgCount_DefaultArgCountZeroZero_Mismatch` now asserts
`ErrArgumentCount`, and a companion test
`Test_validateArgCount_DefaultArgCountZeroZero_ExtensionsAllowsMismatch`
confirms the extensions path returns nil.

## CALL-2 — First extra variadic argument bypasses strict type checking

**Affected function:** `validateStrictParameterTyping`  
**File:** `bytecode/call.go`  
**Risk:** Medium — type-unsafe values can silently reach variadic runtime
functions in strict mode  
**Discovered by:** `Test_validateStrict_Variadic_ExtraArgTypeMismatch`,
`Test_validateStrict_Variadic_SecondExtraArgTypeMismatch`  
**Status: RESOLVED**

### CALL-2: Original behavior

The variadic type-check block fired when `n > len(parms)`, where `n` is the
argument index and `parms` is `dp.Declaration.Parameters`.  For a two-parameter
variadic function `f(a int, b ...int)` with `len(parms) == 2`:

- n=0: `n > 2` → false; `n < 2` → true → regular check on parms[0] ✓
- n=1: `n > 2` → false; `n < 2` → true → regular check on parms[1] ✓
- n=2: `n > 2` → false; `n < 2` → false → **neither block fired** ✗
- n=3: `n > 2` → true → variadic check ✓

The argument at index `n == len(parms)` (the first *extra* variadic arg)
escaped both checks and was never type-validated.

### CALL-2: Fix

The condition was changed from `n > len(parms)` to `n >= len(parms)`, and a
`len(parms) > 0` guard was added to prevent an index-out-of-bounds panic for
the pathological case of a variadic function with no declared parameters:

```go
if dp.Declaration.Variadic && len(parms) > 0 && n >= len(parms) {
```

A `continue` statement was also added after the variadic type-error check to
prevent double-checking (the `n < len(parms)` block below would always be
false for n >= len(parms), but the explicit continue makes the intent clear).

`Test_validateStrict_Variadic_ExtraArgTypeMismatch` now asserts
`ErrArgumentType` for args[2] at the previously unchecked index.

## CALL-3 — Nil pointer dereference in callRuntimeFunction when savedDefinition is nil and context is sandboxed

**Affected function:** `callRuntimeFunction`  
**File:** `bytecode/callRuntimeFunction.go`  
**Risk:** High in sandboxed deployments — accessing `savedDefinition.Sandboxed`
panics when `savedDefinition == nil`  
**Discovered by:** code review during call.go test development  
**Status: RESOLVED**

### CALL-3: Original behavior

`callRuntimeFunction` included this guard:

```go
if c.sandboxedIO.Load() && savedDefinition.Sandboxed {
    return errors.ErrNoPrivilegeForOperation...
}
```

When a bare `func(*symbols.SymbolTable, data.List) (any, error)` was pushed
directly onto the stack (not wrapped in a `data.Function`), `callByteCode`
passed `savedDefinition = nil` to `callRuntimeFunction`.  If the execution
context was sandboxed (`c.sandboxedIO.Load()` returns `true`), Go's `&&`
operator did not short-circuit because the left operand was true, and
`savedDefinition.Sandboxed` panicked with a nil pointer dereference.

In the non-sandboxed default the panic did not occur because the left operand
was false.  The bug was latent in production server code that uses
`ctx.Sandboxed(true)`.

### CALL-3: Fix

A nil check was added as the middle operand:

```go
if c.sandboxedIO.Load() && savedDefinition != nil && savedDefinition.Sandboxed {
    return errors.ErrNoPrivilegeForOperation.Context(savedDefinition.Declaration.Name + "()")
}
```

When `savedDefinition` is nil the middle operand short-circuits and the field
access is never reached.  The function proceeds normally — the bare runtime
function is not sandboxed, so no privilege check is needed.

`Test_callRuntimeFunction_NilDefinition_SandboxedNoPanic` confirms that calling
a bare runtime function with `sandboxedIO = true` no longer panics.

## CALL-4 — `parentTable` nil guard is dead code for non-literal named functions

**Affected function:** `callBytecodeFunction`  
**File:** `bytecode/callBytecodeFunction.go`  
**Risk:** Low — no crash occurs; the behavior is correct despite the dead guard  
**Discovered by:** `Test_callBytecodeFunction_NilFindNextScope_StillSucceeds`  
**Status: RESOLVED**

### CALL-4: Original behavior

`callBytecodeFunction` guarded `parentTable` against nil inside the
`functionSymbols == nil` block using a raw, uninitialized struct literal:

```go
if parentTable == nil {
    parentTable = &symbols.SymbolTable{Name: "<none>"}  // raw struct — nil maps/values
}
```

The guard was never meaningful: for the `callFramePush` path `parentTable`
was not consumed, and for the captured-scope path `capturedScope != nil`
guaranteed `parentTable` was already non-nil.  Meanwhile the package-method
path (`functionSymbols != nil`) had no guard at all, so `Clone(nil)` could
be called when `FindNextScope` returned nil from a root context.

### CALL-4: Fix

The entire `getPackageSymbols()` call and the associated `functionSymbols`
branch were removed from `callBytecodeFunction` (see the broader CALL-4/CALL-5
investigation note below).  The dead nil guard and the raw struct literal
disappeared with the code they guarded.

The log statement is now safe by computing `parentName` conditionally:

```go
parentName := "<none>"
if parentTable != nil {
    parentName = parentTable.Name
}
```

`Test_callBytecodeFunction_NilFindNextScope_StillSucceeds` confirms that a
named function call succeeds from a root-level context (nil `FindNextScope`).

### CALL-4 / CALL-5: Combined investigation note

Fixing CALL-5 (making `getPackageSymbols()` correctly return the package's
embedded symbol table) exposed a deeper issue: the `functionSymbols != nil`
clone path in `callBytecodeFunction` broke global scope access.

When a package function is called as `math.Factor(n)`, the compiler emits
`SetThis` which pushes `math` onto the receiver stack.  After the CALL-5
fix, `getPackageSymbols()` returned the math package's embedded symbol table.
`callBytecodeFunction` then cloned that table and used it as the function's
scope.  The clone only contained the math package's own symbols — not the
global package registry — so any reference inside `Factor` to another package
(e.g. `math.Sqrt`) failed with "unknown identifier".

The root cause: `SetThis` pushes the receiver for ALL member calls, including
plain package-function calls (`math.Floor(x)`) where `callNative` does NOT
pop the receiver (it only calls `popThis()` when `dp.Declaration.Type != nil`).
The receiver stack therefore retains stale package objects, and any subsequent
`*ByteCode` call with a non-empty receiver stack would incorrectly take the
clone path.

The fix: the `getPackageSymbols()` call was removed from `callBytecodeFunction`
entirely.  Compiled Ego functions always use `callFramePush` which creates a
fresh boundary scope as a child of `c.symbols`, giving the function access to
the full scope chain including the global package registry.  The existing
`updatePackageFromLocalSymbols` mechanism in `callFramePop` already handles
writing modified package-level symbols back to the package on return — no
clone path is needed.

## CALL-5 — `getPackageSymbols` passes the `this` struct instead of `this.value` to `GetPackageSymbolTable`

**Affected function:** `getPackageSymbols`  
**File:** `bytecode/flow.go`  
**Risk:** Medium — the package-method cloning path in `callBytecodeFunction`
is permanently unreachable; package method calls silently fall back to the
generic `callFramePush` path  
**Discovered by:** `Test_getPackageSymbols_PackageReceiver_ReturnsSymbolTable`  
**Status: RESOLVED**

### CALL-5: Original behavior

`getPackageSymbols` passed the raw `this` struct (the bookkeeping wrapper) to
`GetPackageSymbolTable` instead of the unwrapped `receiver.value` field:

```go
this := c.receiverStack[len(c.receiverStack)-1]
table := symbols.GetPackageSymbolTable(this)   // ← was: this (the wrapper struct)
```

`c.receiverStack` stores `this{name string, value any}` structs.
`GetPackageSymbolTable` type-asserts its argument to `*data.Package`.  The
assertion on a `this` struct always failed, `nil` was returned, and
`callBytecodeFunction` always took the plain `callFramePush` branch.  The
package-method clone path was permanently dead.

### CALL-5: Fix

One word changed in `flow.go`: the `this` local variable was renamed to
`receiver` (for clarity) and `receiver.value` is now passed:

```go
receiver := c.receiverStack[len(c.receiverStack)-1]
table := symbols.GetPackageSymbolTable(receiver.value)
```

The existing tests were updated:

- `Test_getPackageSymbols_PackageReceiver_CurrentlyReturnsNil` was renamed to
  `Test_getPackageSymbols_PackageReceiver_ReturnsSymbolTable` and now asserts
  a non-nil result with the expected table name `"package math"`.
- `Test_callBytecodeFunction_PackageMethod_ClonesPackageSymbolTable` was added
  to verify the previously dead clone path is now reachable and that the
  resulting scope carries `IsClone() == true`.

## Testing Infrastructure

The comprehensive bytecode unit-test suite is built on shared helpers in
`bytecode/testhelpers_test.go`.  All bytecode instruction tests in this
package use these helpers instead of constructing their own contexts.

### `testContext` builder

Create a fresh context for each test with `newTestContext(t)`, then chain
"with" methods to set up initial state before calling the instruction under
test:

| Method | Effect |
| :----- | :----- |
| `withStack(items...)` | Push items onto the stack left-to-right; last item ends up on top |
| `withSymbol(name, value)` | Create and initialize a named variable in the local symbol table |
| `withArgList(args...)` | Store a `*data.Array` as `__args` (defs.ArgumentListVariable) |
| `withTypeStrictness(level)` | Set strict / relaxed / dynamic type enforcement |
| `withExtensions(bool)` | Enable or disable Ego language extensions |
| `withBytecodeSize(n)` | Set `bc.nextAddress` so addresses 0..n are valid branch targets |

### Assertion helpers

After calling the instruction under test, verify outcomes with these methods:

| Method | What it checks |
| :----- | :------------- |
| `assertNoError(err)` | Fails if err is non-nil |
| `assertError(err, want)` | Compares error keys via `errors.Equals`; context suffixes are ignored |
| `assertTopStack(want)` | Pops the stack top and compares with `reflect.DeepEqual` |
| `assertSymbolValue(name, want)` | Reads the named symbol and compares with `reflect.DeepEqual` |
| `assertStackEmpty()` | Fails if `stackPointer != 0` |
| `assertProgramCounter(want)` | Fails if `ctx.programCounter != want` |

### Key facts for test authors

- **`interface{}` wrapping**: values stored via `data.InterfaceType` are
  wrapped in `data.Interface{Value: v, BaseType: data.TypeOf(v)}`.  Assert
  the wrapped form, not the raw value.
- **Error key comparison**: `assertError` uses `errors.Equals` on the i18n
  key, so `.Context(...)` suffixes added by `runtimeError` are ignored.
- **Stack discipline**: instructions that temporarily push a value must leave
  the stack clean on success.  Use `assertStackEmpty()` to verify.
- **Branch addresses**: `branchByteCode` and the conditional variants validate
  operands against `bc.nextAddress` (not `len(instructions)`).  Call
  `withBytecodeSize(n)` to widen the valid window before testing branches.
- **`__args` type**: `withArgList` stores
  `data.NewArrayFromInterfaces(data.InterfaceType, ...)`.  Storing anything
  other than a `*data.Array` there triggers `ErrInvalidArgumentList`.

### Test file naming convention

Each source file `bytecode/xxx.go` gets a corresponding test file
`bytecode/xxx_test.go`.  Test functions follow the pattern:

```text
Test_xxxByteCode_ScenarioDescription
```

Tests use flat (non-table) style so each case is independently named and
runnable with `-run`.  Sections inside a test file are separated by banner
comments and group related code paths together.

The shared helper infrastructure lives in the `testContext` type defined in
the `bytecode` package test files.  When adding tests for a new instruction,
read that source first — it is the single source of truth for how to create
a context, push stack items, and assert outcomes.
