# LOGIN-H3 — Token signing key stored in plaintext configuration

**Affected file:** `tokens/key.go:13` — `getTokenKey()`

**Description:**  
The AES key used to encrypt all bearer tokens is written to the user's settings
profile (`~/.ego/...`) in plaintext. Anyone with read access to that file can
extract the key and forge valid tokens for any username on that server instance.
The `EGO_SERVER_TOKEN_KEY` environment variable fallback also exposes the key
in the process environment, which is readable by other processes owned by the
same user on Linux (`/proc/<pid>/environ`).

**Recommendation:**  
The token key must not appear in plaintext in any configuration file. Options
include:

- Deriving the key from a master passphrase using PBKDF2 with a stored salt
  (the passphrase is never stored).
- Requiring the operator to supply the key via a secrets manager or sealed
  configuration at startup and refusing to start without it.
- At minimum, verify that the settings file is created with `0600` permissions
  and document the requirement.

**Resolution (April 2026):**  
Upon review, `ego.server.token.key` is already handled by the settings
infrastructure's "outboard encrypted config" mechanism. Sensitive keys listed in
`encryptedKeyValue` (`app-cli/settings/defs.go`) are never written to the main
profile JSON. Instead, each is written to a separate sidecar file (e.g.
`$.key`) encrypted with AES-256-GCM; the encryption passphrase is derived from
`profile.Name + profile.Salt + profile.ID`. The main profile JSON contains no
plaintext token key. This satisfies the "at minimum" requirement above for the
file-backend deployment model. The `EGO_SERVER_TOKEN_KEY` env-var path remains
a minor informational risk (see LOGIN-L1-adjacent concerns) but is not required
for normal operation.
