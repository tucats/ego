# LOGIN-H4 — Login credentials forwarded on HTTP 301 redirect to arbitrary host

**Affected file:** `app-cli/app/logon.go:167`

**Description:**  
When the logon server returns an HTTP 301 redirect, the CLI re-sends the full
credential payload (username + password in the JSON request body) to the
`Location` URL without validating that the redirect target is the same host or
a trusted authority. A network attacker, or a misconfigured authority setting,
can redirect login requests — and the credentials they carry — to an
attacker-controlled host.

**Recommendation:**  
Do not automatically re-send credentials on redirect. Either refuse to follow
3xx responses that contain a body (and ask the user to update their configured
server URL), or validate that the redirect target shares the same origin
(scheme + host + port) before resending. The existing retry loop should at
most follow redirects for unauthenticated probes (heartbeat), not for
credential POST requests.

**Resolution:**  
Redirect following disabled on logon POST; 3xx responses return an error
telling the user to update their server URL.
