# This is the text of the help function, which is available in
# interactive console Ego mode.  Each section starts with ".topic" 
# folllowed by the topic path, where each topic is separated by
# dots. Topic names are always lower-case.
#
# When the user selects a topic, it is located in the file
# and the help for that is printed. If there are additional sub-
# topics they are also printed out as "additional topics" in the
# help output.
#
# If you issue the "help" command wih no argument, it assumes
# the topic is "introduction". If you use "help topics" it causes
# the top-level topics to be listed.
