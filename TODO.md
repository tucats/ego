# TO DO LIST

This list contains things that should be done next with Ego. This is a dynamic list.


1. Create service on the login server that validates a token. When presented with a token
   as payload, will return an error or the user data string for the token to the caller.
   This would be used by any other service that uses the Ego server for login/authentication.
