# Build script for Ego that injects version number, and optionally
# increments it. By default, the build is for the current OS and
# architecture, but you can use command line options to choose
# cross-build operations.

#   -a     Build for Apple Silicon (darwin arm64)
#   -l     Build for Linux (linux amd64)
#   -w     Build for Windows (windows amd64)
#
#   -i     Increment the build number before injecting it.
#          By default, uses the current build number
