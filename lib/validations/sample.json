# Sample JSON validation specification for an endpoint /sample/users for
# a POST method. The specification accepts an object of type "string",
# which can only contain the following values: "red", "blue", "green".
# This validation is loaded into the REST processor when the REST server
# starts, and any attempt to POST to this endpoint will require that the
# JSON payload match this specification.
