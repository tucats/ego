// This file contains default values for whenever a new configuration profile
// is created. These defaults can be set by the system administrator so each
// new profile starts with the same settings. The settings can then be 
// overridden by the users as needed. Note that Ego has some internally defined
// defaults that will also be added to a new profile, but placing a value here
// will override those Ego default values.
